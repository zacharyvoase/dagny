## Empty files deserve poetry.

# She dwelt among the untrodden ways
# Beside the springs of Dove,
# A Maid whom there were none to praise
# And very few to love:
#  
# A violet by a mossy stone
# Half hidden from the eye!
# Fair as a star, when only one
# Is shining in the sky.
#  
# She lived unknown, and few could know
# When Lucy ceased to be;
# But she is in her grave, and oh,
# The difference to me!
# 
# -- William Wordsworth
